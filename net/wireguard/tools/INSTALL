Installation Makefile Target
============================

    # make install

This command takes into account several environment variables:

  * PREFIX               default: /usr
  * DESTDIR              default:
  * BINDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/bin
  * LIBDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/lib
  * MANDIR               default: $(PREFIX)/share/man
  * BASHCOMPDIR          default: $(PREFIX)/share/bash-completion/completions
  * RUNSTATEDIR          default: /var/run
  * PKG_CONFIG           default: pkg-config

  * WITH_BASHCOMPLETION  default: [auto-detect]
  * WITH_WGQUICK         default: [auto-detect]
  * WITH_SYSTEMDUNITS    default: [auto-detect]

The first section is rather standard. The second section is not:

  * WITH_BASHCOMPLETION decides whether or not bash completion files for the
    tools are installed. This is just a nice thing for people who have bash.
    If you don't have bash, or don't want this, set the environment variable
    to `no'. If you'd like to force its use, even if bash-completion isn't
    detected in DESTDIR, then set it to `yes'.

  * WITH_WGQUICK decides whether or not the wg-quick(8) script is installed.
    This is a very quick and dirty bash script for reading a few extra
    variables from wg(8)-style configuration files, and automatically
    configures the interface. If you don't have bash, you probably don't want
    this at all. Likewise, if you already have a working network management
    tool or configuration, you probably want to integrate wg(8) or the direct
    WireGuard API into your network manager, rather than using wg-quick(8).
    But for folks who like simple quick&dirty scripts, this is nice. If you'd
    like to force its use, even if bash isn't detected in DESTDIR, then set it
    to `yes'.

  * WITH_SYSTEMDUNITS decides whether or not systemd units are installed for
    wg-quick(8). If you don't use systemd, you certainly don't want this, and
    should set it to `no'. If systemd isn't auto-detected, but you still would
    like to install it, set this to `yes'.

If you're a simple `make && make install` kind of user, you can get away with
not setting these variables and relying on the auto-detection. However, if
you're writing a package for a distro, you'll want to explicitly set these,
depending on what you want.
